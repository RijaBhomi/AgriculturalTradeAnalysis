# Agricultural Trade Analysis ðŸŒ¾ðŸ“Š

Welcome to the **Agricultural Trade Analysis** project repository! This project is focused on exploring and analyzing trends in agricultural trade using machine learning and data visualization techniques.

## Project Overview
In this project, we:
- **Preprocess** and clean the agricultural trade dataset (`agricultureTrend.csv`).
- Perform **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)** to discover key trends and patterns.
- Implement **Machine Learning Models** to predict and analyze agricultural trade outcomes.
- Apply **Dimensionality Reduction (PCA)** and **Feature Selection** techniques.
- Explore **Clustering (KMeans)** and address class imbalance with **SMOTE**.

## Key Features
- **Visual Insights:** Histograms, bar plots, and correlation heatmaps.
- **Predictive Modeling:** Random Forest, Logistic Regression, Gradient Boosting, and XGBoost.
- **EDA & Insights:** Trend analysis on global agricultural trade data.
